# Why Data Science in Social & Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters

When I first heard about data science, I imagined numbers, charts, and forecasting. Yet the more I learn, the more I see that many of the most fundamental questions are really social ones: What people do, how societies change, how systems impact outcomes. It’s important to model social issues and individuals because one of the only ways to understand patterns is through data. One story is very compelling, but data can help illustrate whether that story is common, who is affected, and what may be driving it. For instance, data may uncover disparities in healthcare, education, transportation, or law enforcement that wouldn’t be apparent through individual experiences.

On the other hand, the use of data about individuals also comes with some very real obligations. Individuals are not simply “data points,” after all, but individuals with a right to privacy, dignity, and context. Even if their names are not present, it may be possible to re-identify them, and even small choices (such as the inclusion of particular variables) may mean revealing a great deal. Fairness, too, may be an obligation, in that a model may learn the biases of the past and then reproduce them. A set of data that represents an inequitable system, for instance, may be taken by the model not as inequitable but simply as the way things are, and recommendations may be made that reinforce the inequity. I believe it is necessary, then, to interrogate the source of the data, who was included and who was excluded, and the assumptions underlying the analysis.

In this class, I’m hoping to gain a better understanding of how to use data science for good. I’m hoping to gain a skill set that will allow me to ask better questions rather than just build better models. I’m hoping to gain experience in being able to communicate my findings clearly and accurately. If data science is ever going to be able to shape decisions for people, it has to be an interdisciplinary field.
